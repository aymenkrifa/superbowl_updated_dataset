# Super Bowl updated Dataset

I'm currently new to Pandas library and Data Science field in general. I just finished a DataCamp guided project where I did some analysis on an old dataset for Super Bowl's games.

I wanted to get an updateted version of the same Dataset, but I couldn't fine one, so I thought to myself what if I gather the new data myself with a little bit of tweaking.

I learned a lot of things while working on this small project and it's just the beginning of my journey in this exciting field.
